# Flappy-Bird
Guided Programming &amp; Non-Guided Advancements of Flappy Bird Game on LOVE2D

The program herein is based on the Harvard CS50 course Lecture 1: Flappy Bird.

The preliminary code was provided by Colton Ogden et al. as part of the course, with advancements and modifications made by myself.

Those advancements and modifications are listed below:

1. Sound Effects were added for the following instances:
-Bird Colliding with the pipes/ground.
-Randomized pool of jump sounds drawn from an array.
-Pause/Resume
-Countdown/Start
-Medal Earned (unique for each medal)
-Pipes Scored
-Background Music 

2. Pause Game State Added
-Created pause game state that suspends play and exchanges positional variables in process of that state change.
-Also pauses the parallax scrolling of the foreground and background.
